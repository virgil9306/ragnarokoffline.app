# Working in this repository

Read [README.md](README.md) first — its **Architecture** section is the real
reference and this file does not replace it. What follows is the part that is
easy to get wrong from inside the tree.

## The one that will bite you: there are two RemoteClients, and we use the Rust one

The asset server is
[**roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-Rust**](https://github.com/Flux159/roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-Rust)
— ours, a Rust rewrite. It ships as the `robrowser-remoteclient` binary and
serves `:3338`.

`vendor/roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-JS/` is the **upstream Node reference we
ported from**. It is kept for comparison. It does not run, and reading it to
answer "what does the server do?" gives answers that are plausible, detailed
and wrong — the two have diverged. Its `path-mapping.json`, for instance, is a
generated file with zero entries, and the Rust port implements no path mapping
at all.

If the checkout is not beside this one, ask rather than reading the JS copy.

**What the Rust server does, in order** (`src/client.rs`, `resolve`):

1. in-memory cache
2. loose files under the server root — `state/assets/`, which is where the
   translation layer and every mod's `data/` land
3. `DATA_OVERRIDE_PATH`
4. the GRFs, under the requested spelling, then under the Korean reading of it

A miss returns 404 and is appended to `state/assets/logs/missing-files.log`.
It never falls back to a different file, so it cannot serve *wrong* content —
only the right file or nothing. When a client renders the wrong sprite, the
asset server is not the suspect; when it renders nothing, that log names the
file.

## The three projects, and where each one's problems show up

| Piece | Ours? | Where it runs | Symptoms it owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| [nebula](https://github.com/Flux159/nebula) | ours | host | the microVM will not boot; guest images; `NEBULA_MIN_VERSION` |
| [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) | upstream, built from our fork [Flux159/rathena](https://github.com/Flux159/rathena), vendored at `vendor/rathena` | in containers, in the VM | anything about rules: drops, refine, quests, NPCs, what a feature flag switches on |
| [roBrowserLegacy](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy) | upstream, built from our fork [Flux159/roBrowserLegacy](https://github.com/Flux159/roBrowserLegacy), plus `patches/` | Chromium, in Electron | anything you can see: UI windows, sprites, packet parsing |
| RemoteClient (Rust) | ours | host, `:3338` | file resolution, GRF decoding, the WS→TCP proxy |

Everything Linux-side runs in containers inside a microVM the app carries. The
server is never ported; we bring the platform it is tested on.

### A fix to rAthena or roBrowserLegacy is a commit on the fork, not a patch

[docs/FORKS.md](docs/FORKS.md) is the reference. The short version:

- A bug in either project is fixed by a commit on the **`ragnarokoffline`**
  branch of our fork, then `scripts/vendor-bump.sh <name>` moves
  `config/VENDOR_PINS` to it. Do **not** add it to `patch-client.sh` or
  `apply-server-mods.sh`; those carry only what is ours (the population engine,
  the stylist, extension hooks, app wording).
- **Open fork PRs against `ragnarokoffline`, not `master`.** Both forks'
  default branch is `master`, a mirror of upstream, so GitHub suggests the wrong
  base. A PR against it picks up every upstream commit the fork hasn't merged
  (rathena#17 arrived with 67). Each fork's own `CLAUDE.md` says the same.
- `ragnarokoffline` refuses force-pushes. Releases pin commits on it, so it only
  moves forward, and newer upstream is **merged** in, never rebased.
- Newer upstream comes in weekly, as pull requests that stop short of merging:
  [docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md).
- Work in a fork checkout beside this one (`~/Projects/rathena`,
  `~/Projects/roBrowserLegacy`). `vendor/` is a pinned copy the build patches in
  place, and anything done there is lost.
- roBrowserLegacy checks files out with CRLF. A whole-file diff means something
  rewrote the line endings.

### Review every change for how hard it makes the next upstream merge

The forks only stay maintainable while each weekly upstream sync merges cleanly
and our fixes can still go back upstream. So a change to rAthena or
roBrowserLegacy, whether a fork PR or an engine patch in
`third-party/population-engine/patches/` that edits rAthena's own files, is
reviewed for that cost as well as for correctness. Ask before merging:

- **How many upstream files does it touch?** A change spread across many of
  them collides with every sync. Prefer one small hook in one place, with the
  logic in a file of our own.
- **Does it patch an upstream core function, or copy one?** A patch in
  `vending_purchasereq` has to be re-checked on every rAthena upgrade. A copy of
  half of `buyingstore_trade` drifts from the original without anyone noticing.
  Both need a strong reason.
- **Could it be contributed upstream as it stands?** A general fix written the
  way upstream writes code can go back. One tangled with our features can't,
  and we carry it forever.
- **Could it live somewhere else?** In a mod, in a server extension that is off
  by default, or in build-time generation, without touching the fork at all?

Bug fixes that mirror a check rAthena already makes are the easy case. Features
that reach into upstream code for one mod's benefit are the ones to push back
on: ask for the smallest general hook instead.

### Server extensions: optional server behaviour, switched on from a mod

When a change to how the server behaves should be optional, it goes behind a
**server extension** in the rAthena fork, not into an unconditional core edit and
not into `apply-server-mods.sh`. An extension is an entry in the fork's
`db/extension_db.yml`, off by default, with optional typed values. The code
checks `extension_enabled("<id>")` / `extension_int(...)` in C++, or
`getextension("<id>")` / `getextensionvalue(...)` in scripts.

A mod turns one on by shipping `db/extension_db.yml` (`Id`, `Enabled: true`,
`Values`). The app merges it into the server's `db/import/` like any other
table. `@extensions` and `@extensioninfo <id>` show what's on in game.

The full guide, for both adding one in the fork and using one from a mod, is
[doc/extensions.md](https://github.com/Flux159/rathena/blob/ragnarokoffline/doc/extensions.md)
in the fork. A mod that depends on an extension needs an app version whose
pinned fork has it.

### Where a change belongs: the mod first, the platform last

Before writing a feature, decide where it should live, and choose the first
place on this list that can hold it:

1. **In the mod itself**: its NPC scripts, `db/` tables, Lua skill hooks and
   client files. Data a person edits, such as a CSV, is turned into the mod's
   files by a build script the mod keeps beside it in `registry/tools/<mod>/`.
   The mod ships the generated files, never the script, and nothing reads a
   file at runtime.
2. **In a small, general hook** that any mod could use, off unless a mod turns
   it on: a server extension, or one client-API call.
3. **In the platform** (the population engine, the supervisor, the shell):
   only when no mod could do it, and only as much as several mods would share.

A feature for one mod does not go into the shared engine or into rAthena. It
does not add platform surface either: no file access for Lua, no new script
commands, no new engine keys just for that mod. Whatever a change adds there,
every later change has to work around, and every rAthena upgrade has to carry.
If you think a hook is needed, propose the smallest general one on an issue
before writing it.

**A worked example, both ways.** #353 added a dynamic market for
prontera-vendors:
- a 607-line runtime in the population engine;
- an engine patch inside rAthena's `vending_purchasereq` and
  `buyingstore_trade`;
- its own stored state, a news scheduler and a board;
- all of it on by default.

It was reverted before release. The same feature fits in the mod: its scripts
keep the price index on a timer, its build script regenerates the price table,
and the engine at most reads a per-item price factor the mod sets.

#376 (waypoint-system) shows the right shape. Its waypoints are a CSV that
`registry/tools/waypoint-system/build_waypoints.py` turns into NPC scripts at
build time. The mod ships only those scripts, and it changes nothing outside
itself.

### The seam where bugs actually live

rAthena and roBrowserLegacy are developed by different people against different
assumptions, and **the app is the only thing that makes them agree**. Both are
compiled/configured to the same packet version. The list is
`config/PACKETVERS` — the first line (**20221005**) is the default and the image
tag, and each other line is another full rAthena build in the same image under
a `-<packetver>` suffix (`images.yml` compiles each on its own runner). Settings → General → Client version picks one; the
supervisor (`stack/src/packetver.rs`) starts that build and rewrites the
client's `packetver`, so the two cannot drift. Only "main" client dates work:
rAthena builds 2015-11-05..2018-07-03 and 2020-09-02..2021-11-18 as RagexeRE,
which roBrowser has no packet tables for.

That still leaves a gap: rAthena will happily use a feature the client has never
implemented. `conf/battle/feature.conf` ships with `feature.refineui: on` and
`feature.stylist: on`; roBrowser implements the refine UI but gates it behind a
config flag, and does not implement the stylist window at all. The result is an
NPC that closes its dialogue and opens nothing.

**So when a UI "does not open", check three things in this order:**

1. Does roBrowser register and hook the packet? Search `Online.js` for the
   packet name, not the hex id — and use *its* names (`OPEN_REFINING_UI`, not
   `ZC_REFINE_OPEN_WINDOW`; `UI_OPEN`, not `ZC_OPEN_UI`).
2. Is it behind a `Configs.get("enable…")` flag? Several are, and
   `Config.js` does not define them all.
3. Does rAthena's script have a non-UI fallback? `getbattleflag("feature.x")`
   in an NPC script usually means it does.

`onUIOpen` handles exactly three `ui_type` values (7 attendance, 8 enchant
grade, 10 enchant). rAthena's enum is in `src/map/clif.hpp` — `OUT_UI_STYLIST`
is 1, and nothing handles it.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `stack/` | `ragnarok-stack`, the Rust supervisor. **No dependencies** — see below |
| `electron/` | the shell: `main.js` (privileged), `preload.js`, IPC |
| `config/Config.local.js` | the roBrowser config **template**; `write_client_config` in `stack/src/assets.rs` rewrites it per era and per mod |
| `config/VENDOR_PINS` | the exact commit of each upstream source; `vendor-fetch.sh` reads it, `vendor-bump.sh` moves it |
| `patches/`, `scripts/patch-client.sh` | roBrowserLegacy additions that are ours; its fixes are on the fork |
| `mods/` | bundled mods, shipped in the app |
| `examples/mods/` | worked examples, not shipped enabled |
| `vendor/rathena` | read it to answer "what does the server do?" |
| `third-party/population-engine` | our modified copy, GPL-3.0, changes marked `RAGNAROKMAC` |

`stack/` and the randomizer have **no crate dependencies**, on purpose: this
ships in a signed bundle, CI has to stay quick, and there is no dependency tree
to audit. Hand-rolled JSON, YAML-shape reading and zlib live there for that
reason. Match it — do not add a crate without saying why.

## Runtime state

`~/Library/Application Support/Ragnarok Offline/` on macOS.

| Path | Notes |
|---|---|
| `state/assets/` | the served root. **Rebuilt from scratch on every `link-assets`** |
| `state/mods/` | installed mods. Deliberately *outside* the asset root so a rebuild cannot destroy them |
| `state/assets/overlay.id` | fingerprint of the mod overlay; the shell clears the client's cache when it changes |
| `state/logs/`, `state/crashes/` | supervisor logs; preserved map-server crashes |
| `File System/` | Chromium's sandboxed FS — **roBrowser's own file cache** |

That last one is worth knowing about: roBrowser saves what it downloads and
looks there before asking the server again, keyed by filename. It survives
restarts, so a mod that replaces a stock file can appear to do nothing while
every status says it worked.

### Looking at the database

`ragnarok-stack sql "<query>"` reads it; `ragnarok-stack sql --write "<stmt>"`
changes it. Reads run against a live server. Writes must not: rAthena keeps
characters, homunculi, pets and inventories in memory and writes them back on
save, so an edit made underneath a running map server is overwritten within the
minute with nothing said. `--write` takes a backup and stops the game for you,
which is the whole reason to use it rather than `docker exec`.

The schema is `vendor/rathena/sql-files/main.sql`, and it is the code in
`vendor/rathena/src/map/` that decides what a column means -- `homunculus.alive`
is in the table and the char server neither reads nor writes it.
[docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) is the reference, with worked repairs.

## Testing

- `cd stack && cargo test` — the supervisor's suite.
- `node --check electron/main.js` after touching the shell.
- `npm start` runs the app from source against the *same* state directory as
  the packaged build, which is still the quickest way to test a shell change —
  **but quit the packaged app first, and let it finish quitting.** The app
  takes a single-instance lock, keyed on Electron's `userData`, and both builds
  resolve that to `Application Support/Ragnarok Offline`. Neither way it fails
  prints anything, so learn to recognise them:
  - packaged app *running*: `npm start` exits 0 on the spot and the packaged
    window comes to the front. Nothing is wrong with your build.
  - packaged app *still quitting*: the teardown holds the lock for the whole
    of `stack down`, and a launch arriving during it is read as "bring the app
    back" — it queues a relaunch, so the **packaged** build reappears and your
    dev run is gone. Wait for it to leave the Dock.
- One copy per set of ports and per data disk. The ports default to 3338
  (assets), 6900/6121/5121 (rAthena) and 7490 (agent API), so a second copy
  given only its own state with `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_HOME` still collides. To run
  one beside the app (the agent test world is the usual case), also give it
  its own `NEBULA_HOME` and move **every** port with
  `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_{ASSET,LOGIN,CHAR,MAP,AGENT}_PORT`. Moving only some of
  them is worse than moving none: nebula forwards a published port that is
  already taken to the engine that took it first, and reports no error.
  [docs/AGENT_TESTING.md](docs/AGENT_TESTING.md#running-beside-the-app) has
  the recipe. `stack/src/ports.rs` is the only parser (`ragnarok-stack ports`
  prints its answer), and the shell and test scripts ask it. Never point two
  supervisors at one data disk: that is how the MariaDB volume loses its redo
  log. `--user-data-dir` gets past the single-instance lock, and with moved
  ports and its own state the second copy can press play too.
- Killing things: `pgrep -x` and kill by PID. `pkill -f <pattern>` has matched
  the agent's own shell in this repo and killed the session.

### Reproducing a bug in the running game

`scripts/rotest` plays the game from the command line against a throwaway
world, never the player's save: log in, `gm "@jobchange 4252"`, `walk`,
`attack`, `skill`, `shot`, `state`, `server logs map`. Every command prints
JSON and screenshots go to `artifacts/rotest/`. [docs/AGENT_TESTING.md](docs/AGENT_TESTING.md)
has the set-up and the commands. Use it to reproduce a client or server bug
before changing anything, and to show the fix works after. Things that will
mislead you:

- Log in as `tester` / `tester123` (the default; `world up` creates it). It
  has GM commands but the client draws it as its real class. The built-in
  `ragnarok` account is on the client's admin list and always shows the GM
  sprite, so screenshots taken on it say nothing about outfits or effects.
- For skill effects, `skill <id> --burst 8` takes frames from the moment of
  the cast; one screenshot a second later misses most of them.
- The client must be the `build:all` build; a partial build has no `api.html`
  and the page says "File not found".
- zsh does not split an unquoted `$var`, so `for c in "150 184"; do rotest
  walk $c` passes one argument. Loop in `bash -c`.
- `pickedByClient: false` from `attack` or `skill --target` means the client
  itself would not select that entity under the cursor. That is a finding.

Check the vendor checkouts are on their pins before you trust a local result:
`scripts/vendor-fetch.sh <name> vendor/<name>` puts one back, and prints
`already at <sha>` when it was fine. Nothing warns you otherwise, and a drifted
`vendor/roBrowserLegacy` means `patch-client.sh` is patching a tree the release
never builds — the CI job clones the `config/VENDOR_PINS` commit fresh every
time, so a patch anchor that matches locally can still fail there. When a pin
has *moved*, `vendor-fetch.sh` (and so `bootstrap.sh`) discards everything in
that checkout except `node_modules` before moving it, and says so -- including
anything edited there by hand, which is why fix work happens in a fork checkout.

**CI runs on every pull request** and every push to `main`: `test.yml`. It
covers less than it sounds like, so know what it leaves out:

- `server-language` — the rAthena diagnostics in `tests/diagnostics/`: each
  must still find its bug in `rathena-upstream`, and must pass on our fork
  before and after `apply-server-mods.sh`.
- `client-build` — the patch set applied twice to the pinned roBrowser, a
  client build, `tests/client-extensions.test.cjs` and the mod-index check.
- `supervisor-and-lifecycle`, on Linux, macOS and Windows — `cargo test` and
  a build of `stack/`, `node --check electron/main.js`, the pinned
  RemoteClient and docker-slim builds, and the shell suite
  (`node --test tests/*.test.cjs`) against those binaries.

Not in CI: the Playwright end-to-end tests (`npm run test:e2e`), the Windows
install acceptance script, and the docs-site build. Nothing in CI starts the app
or a VM either, so an engine or Windows-only change still needs a real machine.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the local build steps for each platform
and which test to run for which change.

`build.yml`, which builds and publishes the installers, runs only on `v*` tags
and manual dispatch. A tag push starts a public release by itself, so tag only
a commit that is already on `origin/main`.
