//! Mods: a folder per mod, assembled into the trees the map server can be given.
//!
//! A mod is a directory under `state/mods/` holding any of:
//!
//!   mod.json  name, version, author, description, and what the mod requires
//!   db/       rAthena override tables -- mob stats, item stats, drops, skills
//!   npc/      scripts: NPCs, warps, spawns, whole custom maps
//!   conf/     a few server settings, from a narrow allowlist (see `conf`)
//!   data/     client assets served ahead of the GRFs (handled in assets.rs)
//!   System/   client Lua tables (handled in assets.rs)
//!   client/   a roBrowser plugin (handled in assets.rs)
//!
//! Nothing here needs a rebuild, which is the whole point: rAthena already
//! reads `db/import` over its own tables, and the map server takes `npc:` lines
//! from the conf directory the app already mounts. This module only has to put
//! the right files in the right place and name them in the config.
//!
//! Mods are merged in name order, so two mods touching one file resolve
//! last-wins, and the order is at least predictable rather than filesystem
//! order.
//!
//! # Refusing a mod
//!
//! A mod can declare what it needs, and one that needs something this build
//! does not have is *refused*: left out of every layer, named, and given a
//! reason the player can read in Settings. Half-applying it instead -- tables
//! loaded, geometry missing -- produces a server that runs and is quietly
//! wrong, which is the failure this is here to prevent.
