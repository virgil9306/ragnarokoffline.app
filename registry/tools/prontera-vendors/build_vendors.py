"""Build prontera-vendors' two YAML files from rAthena's own data.

    python3 registry/tools/prontera-vendors/build_vendors.py [--refresh-prices | --all-prices] [--reprice]

Each theme below says *what* a stall sells: a hand list, a rule over the item
database, or "whatever the monsters of these dungeons drop". The script
resolves that against vendor/rathena (renewal item, mob and spawn databases),
prices every item, and writes:

    db/population_vendors.yml      one VendorKey per theme, with its Pool
    db/population_vendor_pop.yml   one PlacementBound shell profile per theme

Prices come from registry/tools/prontera-vendors/prices.json, a cache of iRO player-market averages
(ragnastats.com, roughly 2013-2020 data). --refresh-prices fetches any item
the cache lacks; --all-prices fetches every tradeable item (about an hour),
so rule themes rank by what players really traded. Delete an entry to fetch
it again.

Prices also go to db/population_vendor_prices/prontera-vendors.csv
(Id,Name,Min,Max), which the server reads and which wins over the YAML. A
re-run keeps every row already there, so hand edits survive; --reprice
rebuilds it from market data instead. Those averages include
refined and carded copies, so for equipment an NPC also sells, the NPC price
wins, and averages that are wildly out of line with an item's NPC value are
treated as trolling and ignored.

The output is ordinary YAML: tune it by hand if you like, but a re-run
overwrites it, so lasting changes belong in this script.

# which items move together (a group shares a move, Share percent of it), and
# the news events that push a group for some days. Items are the ones this
