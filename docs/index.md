# Ragnarok Offline — documentation

A single, self-contained app that runs Ragnarok Online offline: server, client
and game window in one icon.

- **[README](https://github.com/Flux159/ragnarokoffline.app#readme)** — download,
  assets, first launch, and playing with friends on your LAN.

## Guides

- **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** — the things people have actually
  hit: Windows blocking the app, a client folder on the wrong drive, the virtual
  machine refusing to start, and moving your characters to another machine.
- **[Modding](MODDING.md)** — a mod is a folder. Change the world's numbers, add
  NPCs and quests, replace the login and loading screens, build a map that is
  in nobody's GRF, and decide where new characters wake up.
- **[Advanced features](ADVANCED_FEATURES.md)** — backups, disk usage, starting
  over, and the other things you never have to touch.
- **[Running a dedicated server, headless](HEADLESS_SERVER.md)** —
  `ragnarok-stack serve` on a Linux box with no window: settings shared with
  the app, KVM setup, the AppImage, a systemd unit, and what it does not do.
- **[Custom homunculus AI](CUSTOM_HOMUNCULUS_AI.md)** — installing AzzyAI or
  another homunculus and mercenary AI into your own client folder.

## For contributors

- **[Mod system internals](MODDING_INTERNALS.md)** — how each layer is
  assembled, what was measured rather than assumed, and which of the remaining
  limits are decisions rather than bugs.
- **[How we change rAthena and roBrowserLegacy](FORKS.md)** — fixes are
  commits on our forks, pinned by commit; what is still applied by scripts, and
  how to take a newer upstream or send a fix back.
- **[Example mods](https://github.com/Flux159/ragnarokoffline.app/tree/main/examples/mods)**
  — eight mods that have actually been run, each with a README saying what it
  demonstrates.
