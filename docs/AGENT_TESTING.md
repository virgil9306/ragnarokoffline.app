# Driving the game from the command line

`scripts/rotest` plays the game one command at a time. It runs a throwaway
world (its own server VM, database and save), opens the real client in a
browser, and gives you a command for each thing a player does: log in, run GM
commands, walk, attack, cast, look. Each command prints JSON, and screenshots
land in `artifacts/rotest/`.

It was written so an agent can reproduce and verify client and server bugs
without a person at the keyboard. It works just as well by hand.

The client patch behind it, `patches/client/AgentHook.mjs`, does nothing
unless the page opts in. Shipped builds carry it switched off.

## Setting up a world

A world uses the app's ports unless told otherwise, so either quit the
packaged app first (and wait for it to leave the Dock), or move the world's
ports and run it beside the app — see
[Running beside the app](#running-beside-the-app).

Build what the world copies in. The client has to be the **full** build:
`api.html`, which the landing page opens, is only written by `build:all`.

```sh
bash scripts/vendor-fetch.sh roBrowserLegacy vendor/roBrowserLegacy
bash scripts/vendor-fetch.sh ROenglishRE vendor/ROenglishRE
bash scripts/patch-client.sh
npm ci --prefix vendor/roBrowserLegacy
npm --prefix vendor/roBrowserLegacy run build:all
bash scripts/patch-bundle.sh vendor/roBrowserLegacy/dist/Web
cargo build --manifest-path stack/Cargo.toml
bash scripts/build-remoteclient.sh
gh release download images --pattern "images-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/x64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz" --dir dist \
  && mv dist/images-*.tar.gz dist/images.tar.gz   # the server images CI last published
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium
```

Then create and boot the world. It defaults to `artifacts/agent-world`, and
takes the VM runtime and your GRF selection from the installed app's data
folder (override with `RO_E2E_RUNTIME` and `RO_E2E_CLIENT_JSON`):

```sh
scripts/rotest world prepare   # once; refuses an existing folder
scripts/rotest world up        # boots the VM and the servers (a few minutes the first time)
scripts/rotest start           # asset server + browser; add --headed to watch
```

`world up` makes sure the world has two accounts:

| Account | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `tester` / `tester123` | **Use this one.** In the GM group, so `@commands` work, but not on the client's admin list, so the client draws it as its class. Screenshots of jobs, outfits and skill effects come from here. `login` uses it by default. |
| `ragnarok` / `ragnarok` | The built-in GM account every install has. It is on the client's `adminList` (`config/Config.local.js`), so the client draws it with the GM "operator" sprite whatever its job. Use it only to see what a player on the default account sees. |

`rotest world tester` adds `tester` to a world made before `up` did this.
`tester` is still a GM on the server, so for a bug where GM permissions might
matter, check on a group-0 account as well.

```sh
scripts/rotest login tester tester123
scripts/rotest create 0 Tester    # first time only
scripts/rotest char 0
```

## Running beside the app

Every world listens on the same five host ports as the app unless these are
set. Set them in the shell that runs `rotest`, and keep them set for every
`rotest` command against that world — `world up`, `start`, `server`, `world
down`:

| Variable | Default | What listens there |
|---|---|---|
| `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_ASSET_PORT` | 3338 | the asset server; the game page is `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` |
| `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_LOGIN_PORT` | 6900 | rAthena login |
| `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_CHAR_PORT` | 6121 | rAthena char |
| `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_MAP_PORT` | 5121 | rAthena map |
| `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_AGENT_PORT` | 7490 | the shell's AI-agent API, when a test copy of the app is run with `--user-data-dir` |

```sh
export RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_ASSET_PORT=13338 RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_LOGIN_PORT=16900 \
       RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_CHAR_PORT=16121 RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_MAP_PORT=15121 \
       RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_AGENT_PORT=17490 ROTEST_PORT=17480
scripts/rotest world up && scripts/rotest start
```

- Each must be 1024–65535 and all five must differ. The supervisor is the
  only thing that parses them (`ragnarok-stack ports` prints what it settled
  on). The shell, `world.cjs` and `rotest` ask it, and an override it refuses
  stops them. Nothing falls back to the default ports, because the default
  ports belong to the app.
- The world needs a `ragnarok-stack` that knows `ports`. A world prepared
  before this change still has the old one in `runtime/bin`. Copy a current
  build over it, and move the old one aside first.
- rAthena's ports are not remapped. Login tells the client which port char
  is on, and char tells it map's, using the port each server *listens* on. A
  `-p 16121:6121` remap would therefore send the client to 6121, which is the
  app's char server. So the supervisor writes `login_port`, `char_port` and
  `map_port` into the generated `conf/import` files and publishes each port
  one to one.
- The client config names the login port, and `link-assets` writes it. `world
  up` notices when a world's served `Config.local.js` names a different port
  and relinks it from `RO_E2E_CLIENT_JSON`.
- The VM is the world's own. `NEBULA_HOME` is `<world>/nebula`, so its socket,
  pid file, disks and VM are separate from the app's. The engine's own API,
  DNS and k8s ports (7462/42062/6462 in `config/nebula.toml`) are the same
  numbers in both, but `port_conflict = "auto"` moves whichever engine starts
  second, and `world up` stops checking 7462 when ports are moved. Start the
  two one after the other, not at the same moment: nebula checks those ports
  before booting and binds them after, so two engines starting together can
  both pick the same ones.
- If two engines publish the same game port, the second one's forward fails
  and the port silently goes on reaching the first. `docker run` reports no
  error. So a world beside the app must move **all four** game ports, not
  just the asset port.
- `ROTEST_PORT` (default 7480) is the `rotest` daemon's own port. Move it too
  if a second `rotest` is running.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `login [user] [pass]` | the real login form; waits for character select |
| `create <slot> <name>` | the real creation window |
| `char <slot>` | enters the game; returns once the map is loaded and the camera is set |
| `gm <text>` | types into the chat box and sends it; waits out a warp |
| `say <text>` | the same, without the warp wait |
| `state [radius]` | the player, nearby entities (with their click points), chat, mouse, new errors |
| `skills [filter]` | the character's skills: id, name, level, SP, range, target type |
| `shot [name]` | a screenshot; prints the file path |
| `walk <x> <y>` | clicks the map cell, waits for the walk to finish |
| `attack [gid\|nearest\|job:<mob id>] [--quick]` | clicks the monster where the client picks it; `job:1980` is the nearest of that kind, so a stray native monster can't take the click |
| `skill <id> [lv] [--target <gid\|nearest\|job:<mob id>>] [--cell <x> <y>] [--burst N] [--quick]` | starts the cast the way the skill window does, then clicks the target; `--burst` takes N frames 150 ms apart, cropped to the player, from the moment of the cast. `--quick` (also on `attack`) returns as soon as the click is made, with no screenshot or wait, for scripted recordings |
| `camera [zoom Z] [pitch P] [yaw Y] [--over ms]` | sets the camera and prints it; `--over` eases there, for pans and orbits. Stock values: zoom 125 (smaller is closer), pitch 230, yaw 0 |
| `record start <name> [--dir D]`, `record stop` | records the page with the game's music and sound effects; `stop` writes `<name>.mp4` (1080p if the daemon was started with `--size 1920x1080`) to `D`, by default `$ROTEST_OUT/clips` |
| `equip <itemId>` | equips an item already in the inventory (`gm "@item <id>"` first) |
| `hover <x> <y> [--px]` | puts the cursor on a cell (or pixels) and reports what the client sees there |
| `click <x> <y> [right]`, `key <key>` | raw input |
| `eval <js>` | runs JavaScript in the page and prints the result; `window.roAgent` is there |
| `errors` | every page error, console error and failed request since `start` |
| `server <args>` | the world's `ragnarok-stack`: `server logs map 200`, `server sql "SELECT ..."` |
| `stop` | closes the browser and the asset server |
| `world down` | stops the VM; the world folder, its save and backups stay |

Every command that acts also returns the page errors it caused, so a client
exception shows up next to the step that triggered it.

## A session

```sh
scripts/rotest gm "@warp prontera 150 180"
scripts/rotest gm "@baselvl 199"; scripts/rotest gm "@joblvl 49"
scripts/rotest gm "@jobchange 4252"          # Dragon Knight
scripts/rotest gm "@allskill"
scripts/rotest skills servant
scripts/rotest gm "@item 1163"; scripts/rotest equip 1163    # a two-handed sword
scripts/rotest gm "@monster poring 1"
scripts/rotest skill 5208 10 --target nearest               # Hack and Slasher
scripts/rotest shot after-hack
```

`@warp` to a map before testing anything map-specific. `@monster <name|id>
<count>` puts targets next to you. `@item`, `@baselvl`, `@joblvl`,
`@jobchange`, `@allskill`, `@heal` and `@speed` cover most set-up.

## Recording a clip

Start the daemon at the size you want the video (`rotest start --size
1920x1080`), set the scene, then wrap the action in `record start` and `record
stop`. Video is Chromium's screencast (about 60 fps), audio is everything the
client plays, both mixed into an H.264/AAC MP4 at 30 fps.

```sh
scripts/rotest gm "@warp prt_fild08 200 200"
scripts/rotest camera zoom 110 pitch 228
scripts/rotest record start dk-breath --dir ~/Downloads/clips
scripts/rotest gm "@monster 1023 16"
scripts/rotest walk 200 194                                  # they charge in
scripts/rotest skill 6001 10 --target nearest --quick         # Dragonic Breath
scripts/rotest wait 2500
scripts/rotest record stop
```

Things that cost a take:

- A targeted skill clicked while the character is auto-attacking is not sent.
  `walk` to the character's own cell first to drop the attack, then cast.
- A relog starts at the save point; `@save` where the scene is.
- `@mount` toggles. A Dragon Knight who relogs keeps the dragon, and a second
  `@mount` takes it away (Dragonic Breath needs it).
- MVPs often carry `DamageTaken` in `db/re/mob_db.yml` (Baphomet and Boitata
  take 10%), which makes every number small.
- Native monsters keep fighting between takes. A field with weak natives
  (`prt_fild08`) is easier than a dungeon.

## Sweeping a job's skills

`scripts/rotest-skill-sweep.cjs` casts every 3rd/4th-job skill of the jobs you
name, one JSON line per skill. Before each cast it gives the character what
rAthena's `skill_db` requires (a weapon of the right type, ammo, a shield, a
mount, a cart), so a refusal is the game's rule and not a missing weapon. Each
cast gets a tiled sheet of burst frames, so the effect can be checked by eye.
It records the server's chat lines, SP spent, whether the target took damage,
client errors and warnings, and files the asset server could not find.

```sh
python3 scripts/rotest-skill-reqs.py vendor/rathena > artifacts/sweep/skill-reqs.json
node scripts/rotest-skill-sweep.cjs artifacts/sweep/skill-reqs.json 4252 4253 > sweep.jsonl
```

Do it on a field map (`@warp prt_fild08 170 360`); towns forbid some skills.

- `SWEEP_SKILLS=5201,5208` limits it to those ids; `SWEEP_MIN_ID=0` includes
  skills below 2000 (with a `REQS_MIN_ID=0` requirements file).
- `SWEEP_BURST=16 SWEEP_EVERY=250` takes four seconds of frames, for long casts.
- Each line carries `effects`: the effect ids the client started (from
  `roAgent.effects(since)`), with `(not in EffectTable)` on any it could not
  find, and `unhandled`: packets received that the client has no handler for.
- 4th-job skills cost AP, which `@heal` does not restore:
  `rotest server sql --write "UPDATE \`char\` SET ap=max_ap WHERE name='Tester'"`
  while logged out.

## How it works, and what to watch for

- **Never press Escape to cancel something.** Escape opens Game Options, whose
  first button is Character Select, and the next Enter logs the character
  out. `skill` cancels a pending target with a right-click, and `gm`/`say`
  refuse while a menu or dialog is open rather than pressing Enter into it.

- **Clicks are real input.** `walk` projects the cell to the screen and
  clicks it. `attack` and `skill --target` click the middle of the box the
  client itself tests for picking (`EntityManager.intersect`). If the client
  would not pick a monster there, `pickedByClient` comes back `false`. That is
  a finding, not a harness fault.
- **Windows in the way.** A click on a window never reaches the map. `walk`
  and `hover` name the window covering the point instead of clicking it.
- **GM accounts look like GMs.** The client draws any account on its admin
  list with the GM "operator" sprite, whatever the job, as the official client
  does. To check how a job *looks*, use a non-GM account.
- **What the client sent is not what the server did.** Read the chat lines
  each command returns ("The skill cannot be used with this weapon.") and the
  server's own log (`rotest server logs map 200`) before blaming either side.
- **Missing files** are logged by the asset server in the world's
  `state/assets/logs/missing-files.log`. A 404 there names the file.
- **Headless WebGL works**, through ANGLE. `start --headed` shows the window.

## The in-page hook

`window.roAgent` exists only when `localStorage.roAgent` is `'1'`, which the
harness sets before the page loads:

- `player()` and `entities({ type, radius })`: positions, HP, and `click`,
  the screen point a click selects the entity at.
- `project(x, y)`: a map cell in page pixels.
- `skills()`, `useSkill(id, level)`, `chat(n)`, `mouse()`.
- `net(since)`: packets sent and received since a timestamp, with
  `(no handler)` on any the client received and ignored. This is how to tell
  "the client never sent the cast" from "the server refused it" from "the
  server answered and the client did nothing". A refused skill arrives as
  `ZC_ACK_TOUSESKILL`, whose `cause` is rAthena's `useskill_fail_cause`
  (`src/map/clif.hpp`; 9 is overweight, which a long sweep's `@item` stacks
  will reach -- `gm "@itemreset"` clears them).
- `modules`: `Session`, `EntityManager`, `DB`, `Network`, `PACKET`,
  `UIManager` and others, for `rotest eval`.

`roClientDiagnostics` is separate and stays read-only; mods and the e2e suite
use it.
