"""Regenerate the companion skill presets in third-party/population-engine.

WHY this exists: the curated presets in
`third-party/population-engine/files/db/population_skill_db.yml` are what a
companion AI actually casts. They were hand-written per job and went stale at the
top end - the 4th jobs had 3-5 rows each while their class trees grant 56-119
skills, so a drafted Cardinal ran 5 of its 81 legal skills and auto-attacked the
rest of its life. Hand-writing ~1,000 rows is how typos and invented skill names
get in, so the rows are DERIVED from the pinned server databases and this script
is the record of how.

WHAT IT EMITS, per missing legal skill (legal = in the class's skill_tree closure,
i.e. what population_engine_spawn_shell actually grants):

  TargetType  NoDamage  Status   ->  row shape
  Attack      no        -        ->  enemy rotation            { Rate: 9000 }
  Attack      no        - splash ->  enemy rotation            { Rate: 7000, enemy_count_nearby 2 }
  Attack      YES       -        ->  SKIPPED - a stance/combo, not a rotation skill.
                                     9 of 129 4th-job Attack skills, e.g.
                                     DK_CHARGINGPIERCE, a 3-minute buff typed Attack.
  Ground      -         -        ->  enemy rotation, placed near the target
                                     { AroundRange: 2, enemy_count_nearby 2 }
  Support     -         yes      ->  ally buff  { Target: ally, not_ally_status, SC_<status> }
  Support     -         no       ->  ally + self restorative { ally_hp_below, hp_below }
  Self        -         yes      ->  self buff  { Target: self, not_self_status, SC_<status> }
  Self        hits      yes      ->  attack around the caster, only with enemies near
                                     { Target: self, enemy_count_nearby 2 }. Its Status is
                                     what it inflicts (Full Moon Kick blinds), so a
                                     not_self_status row fired it with no enemy in sight.
  Self        -         no       ->  SKIPPED. The buff loop's recast gate resolves a
                                     skill's SC through skill_get_sc() - a C++ table,
                                     independent of this YAML - so a Status-less self
                                     skill cannot be gated by anything written here and
                                     would re-cast every tick, draining SP.

Only the 4th-job classes are regenerated in depth. The 2nd/3rd-job presets carry
hand-tuned conditions and combos (`damaged_gt`, `after_skill`, `skill_used`) that no
generator reproduces, so for those only missing Attack/Ground skills are added and
every existing row is left byte-identical.

GATES (the run aborts rather than emitting something the server cannot use):
  * every CondValue status must exist in `src/map/script_constants.hpp` (the table
    script_get_constant reads), else the engine's resolve_sc_name returns -1 and the
    condition silently never matches
  * rows are inserted INSIDE their `- JobId:` block, above the Footer - appending to
    this file lands them in the Footer's Imports list and kills the map server at boot

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen-population-skill-presets.py                  # dry run: print the plan
    python3 scripts/gen-population-skill-presets.py --write          # apply
    python3 scripts/gen-population-skill-presets.py --rathena ../rathena

After writing, always run the project's own checker and the data guards:
    python3 third-party/population-engine/validate.py     # must print "population data OK"
    node tests/companion-skill-presets.test.cjs

# skill's impl - `status_change_end` - which no YAML field carries), where the branch's generic
# "ally is hurt" gate fires on a healthy ally and wastes the cast. Absorb Spirits needs it too: cast
# on an ally it takes the ally's spheres, so its rows drain a monster for SP when SP is low, as the
# Monk's do. Ki Translation and Power Velocity, which give the caster's spheres away and heal
# nobody, are in SKIP. Everything else that lands in that branch (AM_BERSERKPITCHER) keeps the
# branch's shape, which is what the 4th jobs already ship - Biolo has an AM_BERSERKPITCHER row, so
# excluding them for the 2nd/3rd jobs would make this file inconsistent with its own settled policy.
# WM_DEADHILLHERE is in SKIP instead: it only revives, so the engine casts it on a dead party member.
