// Population engine — Expanded AI Conditions framework.
// Lets `Condition:` in population_skill_db.yml be a boolean tree of predicates
// joined by AND/OR/NAND/NOR/XOR/NXOR gates instead of a single flat token.
//
// Inspired by Singe-Horizontal's "Expanded AI Conditions" patch (2022) but
// scoped to the population engine and the map_session_data data model.
//
// Lifecycle: parsed once during population_skill_db YAML load, stored as
// std::shared_ptr<ExpandedCondition> on s_pop_skill_entry / runtime skill
// structs. Evaluated every skill-pick tick via operator()(sd, target).
