// windows-latest checks text files out with CRLF; normalise on read so assertions about file
// content do not depend on the checkout's newline convention.
// Guards for the per-companion skill selector (phase 1: storage + command).
//
// The feature's whole risk is a WIRING omission, not a logic error: a skill
// selection is useless if one of the four places that must carry it is missed.
// That is this project's documented recurring failure class - a new column
// threaded through three of four touchpoints (recruit REPLACE, recurring
// snapshot UPDATE, recall SELECT, and the shell-field assignment after it) leaves
// the others silently wrong, and the map server reports it only as
// "Unknown column" at login, or not at all.
//
// So every assertion here pins a RELATIONSHIP, not a string:
//   * the recall SELECT lists skill_preset  AND  the row reader reads it
//     AND  it is passed to recall_one_companion  AND  that function declares the
//     parameter  AND  restores it
//   * the seeder calls the filter  AND  the filter is DEFINED in that same
//     translation unit (a call without its definition is a link error, and a grep
//     for the call alone passes on exactly that broken version)
//   * the v7 column exists in the CREATE  AND  in the idempotent migration loop
//     (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is a no-op on an existing table, so a column
//     missing from the loop never reaches a player who already installed)
//
// Calibration: run against the parent commit; the wiring tests below must fail
// there, which is what proves they exercise the change and not a pre-existing fact.
