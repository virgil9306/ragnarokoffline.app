// Guards for the curated skill coverage (the companion rotation data).
//
// Two things this pins, both learned from what the gap audit could NOT see:
//
// 1. PRESENCE IS NOT COMPLETENESS. A block carrying 2 of AL_CURE's 4 statuses counts as "curated"
//    to any presence-based check, while the companion silently cannot cure the other two. The
//    expected status set per cure comes from the skill's own impl (`status_change_end` calls), so
//    it can be asserted exactly.
// 2. A GENERIC SHAPE IS WRONG FOR SOME SKILLS. The generator's Support-without-Status branch gates
//    on "ally is hurt", which is right for a heal and wrong for a cure (gate on the ally HAVING the
//    status), a revive (target must be dead) and a non-restorative utility. Those are named in the
//    generator's HAND_WRITTEN set so a future run does not quietly emit the wrong row.
